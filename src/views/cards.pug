        | What you notice first in
        a(href='http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/') Bootstrap 4
        |  is that
        code .panel
        |  and
        code .well
        |  have been replaced by the
        code .card
        | . This makes a lot of sense as &quot;cards&quot; are one of the more well known trends in responsive design. The
        a(href='') Bootstrap 4 Cards
        |  can be singular, grouped together (as shown) or
        a(href='') equal height
        | . There are many different layout and content options.

              | Cards are a good way to display content composed of different types of objects. They&rsquo;re well-suited for presenting similar objects whose size or supported actions vary, like headings and photos with captions.

              | Use card groups to render equal height cards without gutters between the cards. Use
              code .card-deck
              |  for cards that aren&rsquo;t attached to each another.

              | A frequent problem occurs when you have multiple items in a row with content of varying height. Thanks to flexbox (and display:table) we now have equal height cards!
